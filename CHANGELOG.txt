==================================================
Version 0.3.0 (2020-12-31)
==================================================

- Added an alternative mode for when viewers bet on the same option again called
  Add mode, where subsequent bets add onto the wager instead of replacing it.
  The old behavior is called Set mode and is the default for now.
- Viewers can now use a negative number as the amount when using the bet
  command. In Add mode this results in subtraction from the wager. In Set mode
  it removes the bet, as if "bet 0" was used.
- Viewers can now bet on options using the option name instead of the option's
  index number. This is case insensitive, but other than that they must type
  the name exactly right.
- If a viewer tries to bet using more points than they have available, the max
  amount is used instead, as if "bet all" was used. Until now, the command would
  be ignored.
- Settings are now stored in a backwards compatible format, so starting with the
  next version you won't have to input your settings again after updates.
- Got rid of the "anonymous mode." I couldn't see a use case where it would be
  useful at all.
- The program now statically links with the runtime library, meaning you don't
  need any extra dll files in the program folder.
- Adjusted message rates. The bot doesn't spam quite as much when in moderator
  mode, but is still twice as fast as non-moderator mode.
- The GUI now makes slightly better use of the window width in the option
  list.
- Links in the help section are now clickable.
- Updated contact email address in help section.
- Improved logging of errors.
- Bug fixes:
  - Now prevents integer overflow when handing out points.
  - Fix a buffer overflow that might happen while the stats window was open.

  the bot to join the wrong room.
- Improved error handling for certain functions.
